# Everyone Sees Everyone

This repo will help you manage everyone pairing with everyone (especially online).

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## How to start

In `App.jsx`, change the `title` variable and change the people in the `init` array to your list of peeps.

Once running, you will see a list of peeps arranged into "rooms" on `localhost:3000`. Clicking the "move" button will shift everyone to their next pair.

If there are uneven numbers, there will be one rest room which will just contain one person each cycle.
